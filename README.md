* Check out `docs/example.cpp` for example uses to get started
* Use provided makefile to build the library
* Check out `docs/design-choices.md` to learn about the inner workings of the library
* Check out `docs/benchmarks.md` for benchmark data. Feel free to tell me more use cases you would like to be benchmarked
